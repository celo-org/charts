Please take into account that webhook execution order is done alphabetically.
If there is any other webhook that modifies the images executed (i.e.: `policy.sigstore.dev`),
you may need/want the name of the webhook (i.e.: `.Values.fullnameOverride`) first 
based on alphabetical order.

To check the existing webhooks of your cluster:

  $ kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io
